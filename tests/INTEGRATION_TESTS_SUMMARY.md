# Run with coverage
python tests/run_qt_theme_breadcrumb_integration_tests.py --coverage

# Run specific category
python tests/run_qt_theme_breadcrumb_integration_tests.py --category theme

# Run platform-specific tests only
python tests/run_qt_theme_breadcrumb_integration_tests.py --platform-only

# Validate test environment
python tests/run_qt_theme_breadcrumb_integration_tests.py --validate
```

### Pytest Configuration (`pytest_qt_theme_breadcrumb.ini`)
**Test configuration and markers:**
- Test discovery configuration
- Asyncio mode setup
- Coverage configuration
- Test markers for categorization
- Output formatting options

## Implementation Fixes

During test implementation, several compatibility issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Async/Sync Compatibility Issues
**Problem:** Components had mixed async/sync method calls causing runtime errors.
**Solution:**
- Fixed `_apply_optimized_path_truncation()` method to be synchronous
- Updated performance optimizer initialization to handle missing event loops
- Added graceful fallback for async operations in sync contexts

### 2. Performance Optimizer Integration
**Problem:** Performance optimizer tried to create async tasks without event loops during testing.
**Solution:**
- Added optional performance optimizer initialization
- Implemented event loop detection before starting optimization
- Added fallback behavior when optimization is unavailable

### 3. Mock Object Integration
**Problem:** Tests needed proper mock objects for complex component interactions.
**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive mock classes for theme managers and navigation components
- Implemented proper fixture management for test isolation
- Added configuration mocking for consistent test behavior

## Test Execution Results

The integration tests are now functional and can be executed. Key achievements:

1. **Test Infrastructure Complete** - All test files created and functional
2. **Component Compatibility Fixed** - Resolved async/sync issues in core components
