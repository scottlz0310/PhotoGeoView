     - CI-specific metrics (logs size, reports size, history size)
     - Alert system with configurable thresholds
     - Multiple notification channels (console, file, email)

3. **PhotoGeoView Project Default Configuration**
   - ✅ Generated optimized configuration at `.kiro/settings/production_config.json`
   - ✅ Updated CI Simulator configuration at `.kiro/settings/ci_simulator.json`
