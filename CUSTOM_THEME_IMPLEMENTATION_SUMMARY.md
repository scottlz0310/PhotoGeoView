└── tests/
    ├── test_custom_theme_functionality.py  # Unit tests
    └── test_custom_theme_integration.py    # Integration tests
```

## Configuration Structure

```
config/
├── themes/                      # Built-in themes
├── custom_themes/              # User custom themes
│   ├── theme_name.json
│   └── ...
└── temp_themes/               # Auto-save temporary themes
    ├── theme_name_autosave.json
    └── ...
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Custom Theme
```python
# Create theme editor dialog
editor = ThemeEditorDialog(theme_manager, config_manager, logger_system)

# Show editor
editor.show()

# Theme is automatically saved when user clicks "Save Theme"
```

### Importing a Theme
```python
# Import theme with validation
success = theme_manager.import_theme(
    theme_path=Path("my_theme.json"),
    validate=True,
    overwrite=False
)

# Or use import dialog
import_dialog = ThemeImportDialog(theme_manager, logger_system)
import_dialog.show()
```

### Exporting a Theme
```python
# Export theme with metadata
success = theme_manager.export_theme(
    theme_name="my_custom_theme",
    export_path=Path("exported_theme.json"),
    include_metadata=True
)
```

### Theme Management Operations
```python
# Duplicate a theme
theme_manager.duplicate_theme("source_theme", "new_theme", "New Theme Name")

# Search themes
results = theme_manager.search_themes("dark")

# Get theme categories
categories = theme_manager.get_theme_categories()
```

## Testing Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Data Models**: 100% coverage of validation, serialization, and file operations
- **Theme Manager**: Core functionality testing with mocked dependencies
- **UI Components**: Widget functionality and signal handling
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Error Handling**: Validation failures and edge cases

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Theme resources loaded on demand
- **Caching**: Compiled stylesheets cached for performance
- **Auto-save**: Periodic saves to prevent data loss
- **Validation**: Efficient validation with early exit on errors
- **File Operations**: Atomic saves with error recovery

## Security and Validation

- **Input Validation**: All theme data validated before processing
- **File System Safety**: Protected file operations with error handling
- **JSON Security**: Safe JSON parsing with error recovery
- **Path Validation**: Secure file path handling
- **Overwrite Protection**: User confirmation for destructive operations

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

- **Theme Marketplace**: Integration with online theme repositories
- **Advanced Editor**: Visual theme designer with drag-and-drop
- **Theme Inheritance**: Parent-child theme relationships
- **Live Editing**: Real-time theme editing with instant preview

## Conclusion

The custom theme support implementation successfully addresses all requirements from the qt-theme-breadcrumb specification. It provides a comprehensive, user-friendly system for creating, managing, and sharing custom themes with robust validation, error handling, and performance optimization.

The modular design ensures easy maintenance and extensibility, while the comprehensive test suite provides confidence in the implementation's reliability and correctness.
