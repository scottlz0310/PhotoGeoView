# Performance Analyzer Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the PerformanceAnalyzer class for the CI simulation tool, completing tasks 7.1 and 7.2 from the implementation plan.

## Implementation Details

### Task 7.1: ベンチマーク実行付きPerformanceAnalyzerの実装

**File:** `tools/ci/checkers/performance_analyzer.py`

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Core PerformanceAnalyzer Class**
   - Inherits from `CheckerInterface` for consistency with existing architecture
   - Configurable benchmark timeout, memory sampling interval, and regression thresholds
   - Automatic directory creation for results and baseline storage

2. **Benchmark Test Suite**
   - `file_discovery`: Simulates file system scanning operations
   - `image_processing`: Simulates image loading and processing tasks
   - `ui_responsiveness`: Simulates UI operation response times
   - `memory_efficiency`: Tests memory allocation and deallocation patterns
   - `concurrent_operations`: Tests parallel processing performance

3. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Real-time memory usage tracking (RSS memory in MB)
   - CPU utilization monitoring (peak and average percentages)
   - Configurable sampling intervals for accurate measurements
   - Thread-based monitoring to avoid interference with benchmark execution

4. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   - System-wide memory and CPU usage
   - Process-specific resource consumption
   - Disk I/O metrics (when available)
   - Throughput calculations for applicable benchmarks

5. **Results Storage and Management**
   - JSON-based result persistence with timestamps
   - Automatic baseline file management
   - Historical data preservation for trend analysis
   - Structured data format for machine processing

### Task 7.2: パフォーマンス回帰検出の実装

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Regression Detection Engine**
   - Configurable regression thresholds (default 30%)
   - Multi-metric regression analysis (duration, memory, throughput)
   - Severity classification (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Detailed regression reporting with baseline comparisons

2. **Baseline Comparison Logic**
   - Automatic baseline loading and validation
   - Percentage-based regression calculation
   - Threshold-based regression filtering
   - Support for multiple performance metrics

3. **Trend Analysis System**
   - Historical data analysis over configurable time periods
   - Linear regression slope calculation for trend detection
   - Trend direction classification (improving, worsening, stable)
   - Statistical analysis of performance changes over time

4. **Advanced Reporting**
   - Comprehensive Markdown regression reports
   - Executive summaries with severity breakdowns
   - Actionable recommendations based on regression patterns
   - Trend analysis reports with improvement suggestions

## Data Models

### BenchmarkResult
- Complete benchmark execution results
- Resource usage statistics
- Performance metrics and metadata
- Timestamp and error tracking

### PerformanceMetric
- Individual metric measurements
- Unit specification and metadata
- Timestamp tracking for trend analysis

### RegressionIssue
- Detailed regression information
- Severity classification
- Baseline vs current value comparison
- Descriptive analysis and recommendations

## Integration Features

1. **CheckerInterface Compliance**
   - Consistent API with other CI checkers
   - Proper error handling and status reporting
   - Configurable execution parameters

2. **Factory Registration**
   - Registered with CheckerFactory as 'performance' type
   - Available through standard checker instantiation
   - Integrated with existing CI orchestration system

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Flexible configuration through config dictionary
   - Environment-specific settings support
   - Default value fallbacks for all parameters

## Testing and Validation

### Test Files Created:
- `simple_performance_test.py`: Basic functionality verification
- `test_performance_integration.py`: Integration with CI system
- `test_performance_analyzer.py`: Comprehensive test suite (for future use)

### Test Results:
- ✅ Import and instantiation successful
- ✅ CheckerInterface compliance verified
- ✅ Factory registration working
- ✅ Basic benchmark execution functional
- ✅ Resource monitoring operational

## Usage Example

```python
from tools.ci.checkers.performance_analyzer import PerformanceAnalyzer

# Configure the analyzer
config = {
    'benchmark_timeout': 300,
    'regression_threshold': 30.0,
    'baseline_file': '.kiro/ci-history/performance_baseline.json',
    'results_dir': 'reports/ci-simulation/performance'
}

# Create and run analyzer
analyzer = PerformanceAnalyzer(config)
result = analyzer.run_check()

# Check for regressions
regressions = analyzer.detect_performance_regression(threshold=25.0)

# Analyze trends
trends = analyzer.analyze_performance_trends(history_days=30)
```
