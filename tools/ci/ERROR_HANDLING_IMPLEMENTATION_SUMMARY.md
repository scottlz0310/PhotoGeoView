- **Error Reporting**: Generates detailed error reports with statistics and recommendations

**Recovery Actions Implemented:**
- System dependency installation
- Alternative Python version usage
- Configuration repair and fallback
- Resource cleanup and optimization
- Dependency installation
- Timeout handling

- **System Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and status reporting
- **Integrated Reporting**: Combined reports showing errors, resources, and system health
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Context-aware suggestions for different error types
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Coordinated cleanup of both errors and resources

## Implementation Details

### Error Classification System

```python
class ErrorCategory(Enum):
    ENVIRONMENT = "environment"      # Python version, system dependencies
    CONFIGURATION = "configuration" # Config files, settings
    EXECUTION = "execution"         # Runtime errors, test failures
    DEPENDENCY = "dependency"       # Missing packages, version conflicts
    RESOURCE = "resource"           # Memory, disk space issues
    NETWORK = "network"             # Connection, timeout issues
    PERMISSION = "permission"       # File access, privileges
    TIMEOUT = "timeout"             # Operation timeouts
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"             # Unclassified errors
```

### Recovery Strategy Framework

```python
class RecoveryStrategy(Enum):
    RETRY = "retry"           # Retry the operation
    FALLBACK = "fallback"     # Use alternative approach
    SKIP = "skip"             # Skip and continue
    ABORT = "abort"           # Stop execution
    MANUAL = "manual"         # Require user intervention
    AUTO_FIX = "auto_fix"     # Automatic repair attempt
```

### Resource Management Architecture

- **Context Managers**: Safe temporary resource creation with automatic cleanup
- **Background Monitoring**: Continuous resource usage tracking
- **Threshold Actions**: Automatic cleanup when limits are exceeded
- **Signal Handling**: Proper cleanup on system signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality under resource constraints

## Usage Examples

### Basic Error Handling

```python
from error_recovery_system import get_error_recovery_system

system = get_error_recovery_system()

try:
    # Some operation that might fail
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    error_context = system.handle_error_with_resources(
        error=e,
        component="my_component",
        operation="risky_operation"
    )
    # Error is automatically classified, recovery attempted, and logged
```

### Resource Management

```python
from resource_manager import get_resource_manager

manager = get_resource_manager()

# Temporary directory with automatic cleanup
with manager.temp_directory(prefix="test_") as temp_dir:
    # Use temporary directory
    process_files_in_directory(temp_dir)
# Directory is automatically cleaned up

# Manual resource tracking
resource_id = manager.register_temp_resource("/path/to/file", "file")
# ... use resource ...
manager.cleanup_resource(resource_id)
```

### System Health Monitoring

```python
system = get_error_recovery_system()

# Check system health
health = system.check_system_health()
print(f"System Status: {health.system_status}")
print(f"Memory Usage: {health.memory_percent}%")

# Generate health report
system.save_health_report("reports/health.md")
```

## Configuration Options

### Error Handler Configuration

```python
error_config = {
    'max_retry_attempts': 3,
    'retry_delay': 1.0,
    'auto_recovery_enabled': True
}
```

### Resource Manager Configuration

```python
resource_config = {
    'max_memory_percent': 80.0,
    'max_disk_percent': 90.0,
    'cleanup_interval': 300,
    'temp_file_max_age': 3600,
    'monitoring_enabled': True
}
```

## Generated Reports

The system generates three types of reports:

1. **Error Report**: Detailed error information with troubleshooting guidance
2. **Resource Report**: Resource usage statistics and temporary resource details
3. **Health Report**: Combined system health status with recommendations

Reports are generated in Markdown format and saved to the `reports/` directory.
