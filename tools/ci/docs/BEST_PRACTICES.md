## Development Workflow

### 1. Pre-Commit Workflow

**Recommended Approach:**

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
git add .

# 2. Run quick checks during development
python tools/ci/simulator.py run code_quality --timeout 60

# 3. Fix any issues found
# ... make fixes ...

# 4. Run comprehensive checks before commit
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --exclude performance_analyzer

# 5. Commit only if all checks pass
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**Why this works:**
- Quick feedback during development
- Comprehensive validation before commit
- Prevents broken commits from entering the repository

### 2. Feature Development Workflow

**For new features:**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Develop with frequent quick checks
python tools/ci/simulator.py run code_quality test_runner

# 3. Before pushing, run full validation
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all

# 4. Push only after all checks pass
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

**For bug fixes:**

```bash
# 1. Create bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-123

# 2. Write test to reproduce the bug
python tools/ci/simulator.py run test_runner

# 3. Fix the bug
# ... implement fix ...

# 4. Verify fix with comprehensive checks
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all

# 5. Push the fix
git push origin fix/issue-123
```

### 3. Code Review Preparation

**Before requesting code review:**

```bash
# 1. Run all checks with multiple Python versions
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --python-versions 3.9 3.10 3.11

# 2. Generate comprehensive report
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --format both --output-dir ./review-reports

# 3. Review the generated reports
cat review-reports/ci_report_*.md

# 4. Address any issues before submitting for review
```

## Configuration Management

### 1. Layered Configuration Strategy

**Use multiple configuration levels:**

1. **Global defaults** (`tools/ci/ci-config.yml`):
   ```yaml
   # Team-wide standards
   python_versions:
     - "3.10"
     - "3.11"

   checks:
     code_quality:
       enabled: true
       black:
         line_length: 88
   ```

2. **Project-specific** (`.kiro/ci-config.yml`):
   ```yaml
   # Project overrides
   project:
     name: "PhotoGeoView"
     type: "qt_application"

   checks:
     ai_component_tester:
       enabled: true
   ```

3. **Developer-specific** (environment variables):
   ```bash
   # In ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
   export CI_PARALLEL=4
   export CI_TIMEOUT=300
   ```

### 2. Configuration Best Practices

**DO:**
- Version control your configuration files
- Use comments to explain project-specific settings
- Keep sensitive information in environment variables
- Regularly review and update configurations

**DON'T:**
- Hard-code paths or system-specific values
- Include credentials in configuration files
- Override safety-critical settings without team approval

**Example of good configuration:**

```yaml
# PhotoGeoView CI Configuration
# Last updated: 2024-01-15
# Maintainer: Development Team

project:
  name: "PhotoGeoView"
  type: "qt_application"
  description: "AI-integrated photo geolocation viewer"

# Python versions supported by the project
python_versions:
  - "3.10"  # Minimum supported
  - "3.11"  # Recommended for development

checks:
  code_quality:
    enabled: true
    # Use Black with 88-character line length (team standard)
    black:
      line_length: 88
      target_version: ["py310"]

    # isort configuration to work with Black
    isort:
      profile: "black"
      multi_line_output: 3

    # flake8 configuration
    flake8:
      max_line_length: 88
      ignore: ["E203", "W503"]  # Black compatibility

    # mypy configuration - gradually increasing strictness
    mypy:
      strict: false  # TODO: Enable when legacy code is updated
      warn_return_any: true
      warn_unused_configs: true

  test_runner:
    enabled: true
    timeout: 300
    coverage: true
    # Qt-specific test configuration
    qt_tests: true
    virtual_display: true

  security_scanner:
    enabled: true
    # Skip known false positives
    safety:
      ignore_ids: [12345]  # Document why these are ignored

  performance_analyzer:
    enabled: true
    # Performance regression threshold (30% slowdown triggers warning)
    regression_threshold: 30.0
    benchmark_timeout: 600

  ai_component_tester:
    enabled: true
    # Test all AI integrations
    copilot: true
    cursor: true
    kiro: true

# Output configuration
output:
  directory: "reports/ci-simulation"
  formats: ["markdown", "json"]
  keep_history: 30  # Keep 30 days of history

# Execution configuration
execution:
  max_parallel: 4
  timeout: 1800  # 30 minutes maximum
  fail_fast: false  # Continue running other checks if one fails

# Directory configuration
directories:
  temp: "temp/ci-simulation"
  logs: "logs"
  reports: "reports/ci-simulation"
  history: ".kiro/ci-history"

# Cleanup configuration
cleanup:
  auto_cleanup: true
  keep_reports: 10
  keep_history: 30
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Selective Execution Strategies

**During active development:**
```bash
# Quick feedback loop
python tools/ci/simulator.py run code_quality --timeout 60

# Focus on changed files only (if supported)
python tools/ci/simulator.py run code_quality --changed-only
```

**Before committing:**
```bash
# Essential checks only
python tools/ci/simulator.py run code_quality test_runner security_scanner
```

**Before pushing:**
```bash
# Comprehensive validation
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all
```

**Nightly/CI integration:**
```bash
# Full validation with all Python versions
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --python-versions 3.9 3.10 3.11
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Optimization

**Configure based on your system:**

```yaml
# For development machines (4-8 cores)
execution:
  max_parallel: 4

# For high-end workstations (8+ cores)
execution:
  max_parallel: 8

# For CI servers (variable resources)
execution:
  max_parallel: auto  # Auto-detect based on available resources
```

**Monitor resource usage:**
```bash
# Run with resource monitoring
htop &
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --parallel 4
```

### 3. Caching Strategies

**Leverage built-in caching:**
- Tool results are automatically cached
- Incremental runs only process changed files
- Performance baselines are preserved

**Optimize cache usage:**
```yaml
# Configuration for better caching
cache:
  enabled: true
  directory: ".kiro/cache"
  max_size: "1GB"
  ttl: 3600  # 1 hour cache lifetime
```

## Team Collaboration

### 1. Shared Standards

**Establish team-wide standards:**

```yaml
# Team configuration template
team_standards:
  code_style:
    line_length: 88
    import_style: "black"
    type_checking: "gradual"  # Gradually increase strictness

  testing:
    minimum_coverage: 80
    require_integration_tests: true

  security:
    vulnerability_tolerance: "medium"
    require_security_review: true
```

**Document decisions:**
```markdown
# Team CI Standards

## Code Quality
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Import sorting: isort with Black profile
- Type hints: Required for new code, encouraged for existing code

## Testing
- Minimum test coverage: 80%
- All new features require integration tests
- Performance tests required for critical paths

## Security
- All dependencies must pass security scan
- Medium and high severity vulnerabilities must be addressed
- Security review required for authentication/authorization changes
```

# This installs:
# - pre-commit: Quick checks (code_quality)
# - pre-push: Comprehensive checks (all except performance)
```

**Custom hook configuration:**

```json
{
  "pre-commit": {
    "checks": ["code_quality"],
    "timeout": 120,
    "fail_fast": true
  },
  "pre-push": {
    "checks": ["code_quality", "test_runner", "security_scanner"],
    "timeout": 600,
    "fail_fast": false
  }
}
```

### 2. Branch-Specific Strategies

**Feature branches:**
```bash
# Lighter checks for rapid development
python tools/ci/simulator.py run code_quality test_runner
```

**Main/develop branches:**
```bash
# Comprehensive validation
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --python-versions 3.10 3.11
```

**Release branches:**
```bash
# Full validation with performance analysis
python tools/ci/simulator.py run --all --python-versions 3.9 3.10 3.11
```
