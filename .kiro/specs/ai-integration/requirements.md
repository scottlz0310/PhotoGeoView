# Requirements Document

## Introduction

PhotoGeoViewプロジェクトにおいて、GitHub Copilot版（CS4Coding）、Cursor版（CursorBLD）、そしてKiro版の3つのAI開発成果を統合し、各AIエージェントの強みを活かした最適なハイブリッド構成のアプリケーションを構築する。この統合により、単独のAI開発では実現できない高品質で保守性の高いPhotoGeoViewアプリケーションを実現する。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the UI/UX excellence of CursorBLD with the core functionality stability of CS4Coding, so that users can enjoy both intuitive operation and reliable features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load CursorBLD's theme management system with 16 theme variations
2. WHEN a user selects a folder THEN the system SHALL display thumbnails using CursorBLD's optimized thumbnail generation
3. WHEN a user selects an image THEN the system SHALL extract EXIF data using CS4Coding's high-precision parser
4. WHEN GPS data is available THEN the system SHALL display the location using CS4Coding's stable folium integration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a unified architecture managed by Kiro, so that the integrated application maintains consistency and quality across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating different AI implementations THEN Kiro SHALL provide unified error handling across all modules
2. WHEN performance optimization is needed THEN Kiro SHALL implement memory management and caching strategies
3. WHEN code quality needs to be maintained THEN Kiro SHALL enforce consistent coding standards and documentation
4. WHEN testing is required THEN Kiro SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage for integrated components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a seamless experience that combines the best features from all AI implementations, so that I can efficiently manage and view my photo collection with geographic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the application THEN I SHALL see CursorBLD's intuitive interface with CS4Coding's reliable functionality
2. WHEN I browse folders THEN I SHALL experience fast thumbnail loading with accurate EXIF information display
3. WHEN I view images THEN I SHALL have smooth zoom/pan operations with precise GPS location mapping
4. WHEN I switch themes THEN I SHALL see immediate visual changes without affecting core functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a well-structured codebase with clear AI role separation, so that future development and maintenance can be efficiently managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code structure THEN each AI's contribution SHALL be clearly documented and attributed
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns for AI collaboration
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN logs SHALL clearly indicate which AI component is involved
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility across all AI-integrated components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and quality assurance, so that the integrated application maintains high reliability and performance standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN automated tests SHALL verify integration between AI components
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN monitoring systems SHALL alert and provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN new features are added THEN compatibility tests SHALL ensure no regression in existing functionality
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL validate that all AI components work together correctly
