# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Qt theme management system and breadcrumb-style address bar for PhotoGeoView. The theme manager will provide dynamic theme switching capabilities with customizable UI elements, while the breadcrumb address bar will offer intuitive navigation through folder hierarchies with clickable path segments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different visual themes, so that I can customize the application appearance to my preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the theme selection menu THEN the system SHALL display all available themes with preview thumbnails
2. WHEN the user selects a theme THEN the system SHALL apply the theme immediately to all UI components
3. WHEN the user changes themes THEN the system SHALL persist the theme selection for future sessions
4. IF a theme file is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default theme and display an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through folder paths using a breadcrumb address bar, so that I can easily understand my current location and quickly jump to parent directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to a folder THEN the system SHALL display the full path as clickable breadcrumb segments
2. WHEN the user clicks on any breadcrumb segment THEN the system SHALL navigate to that directory level
3. WHEN the path is too long for the available space THEN the system SHALL truncate the path intelligently while maintaining usability
4. WHEN the user hovers over a breadcrumb segment THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating it's clickable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme system to support custom themes, so that I can create or import personalized visual styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user imports a theme file THEN the system SHALL validate the theme format and add it to available themes
2. WHEN the user creates a custom theme THEN the system SHALL provide a theme editor interface with color pickers and style options
3. WHEN the user exports a theme THEN the system SHALL generate a portable theme file that can be shared
4. IF a custom theme has invalid properties THEN the system SHALL use default values for invalid properties and warn the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the breadcrumb address bar to integrate with the file system watcher, so that path changes are reflected immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current directory is renamed or moved THEN the system SHALL update the breadcrumb path automatically
2. WHEN a parent directory in the breadcrumb path is deleted THEN the system SHALL navigate to the nearest existing parent directory
3. WHEN the file system watcher detects path changes THEN the system SHALL refresh the breadcrumb display within 500ms
4. WHEN network drives are disconnected THEN the system SHALL handle breadcrumb navigation gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to be extensible, so that new UI components can easily adopt the theming system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new UI component is added THEN the component SHALL be able to register for theme change notifications
2. WHEN themes are switched THEN all registered components SHALL receive theme update events with the new style properties
3. WHEN components request theme properties THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent API for accessing colors, fonts, and styling information
4. IF a component requests a non-existent theme property THEN the system SHALL return a sensible default value and log the missing property

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts for theme switching and breadcrumb navigation, so that I can efficiently control these features without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+T THEN the system SHALL open the theme selection dialog
2. WHEN the user presses Alt+Up THEN the system SHALL navigate to the parent directory via breadcrumb navigation
3. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+Shift+T THEN the system SHALL cycle through available themes
4. WHEN the breadcrumb bar has focus and user presses Tab THEN the system SHALL navigate between breadcrumb segments
